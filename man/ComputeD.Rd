\title{A helper function for computing D-coefficients used in the case of the overlapping sample \insertCite{BODNAR21dynshrink}{DOSPortfolio}}
\usage{
ComputeD(Ci, Cj)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ci}{a number equal to the concentration ratio of period i}

\item{Cj}{a number equal to the concentration ratio of period j}
}
\value{
a number
}
\description{
The function computes the \eqn{D_{j,i}} coefficients from Eq. (2.21) in \insertCite{BODNAR21dynshrink;textual}{DOSPortfolio},
which are used in the recursive computation of the dynamic shrinkage estimator of the GMV portfolio weights in the case
of overlapping samples.
