Description: 
  Constructs dynamic optimal shrinkage estimators for the weights of the global minimum variance portfolio which are reconstructed at given reallocation points as derived in Bodnar, Parolya, and Thorsén (2021) (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02131>). Two dynamic shrinkage estimators are available in this package. One using overlapping samples while the other use nonoverlapping samples.
